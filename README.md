# DemoProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This game was created as part of an assignment for the game developer position in RICRYM

It is a multiplayer game that requires the player to work together to defeat monsters.

The game has two playable character class. A warrior class and a mage class.

Warrior deal melee damage using stamina, mage deals magic damage using mana.

The warrior can swing his sword and deal damage to enemies by using the left mouse button.

The mage can cast a magic bullet spell and an AOE spell to attack the enemies using left mouse and 'F' button respectively.

The right mouse button can be used to face the player forward.

The project can be loaded into Unreal Engine 5.5 and be played that way.

Unfortunately I cannot push the recent updated one because of this error:
'batch response: This repository is over its data quota. Account responsible for LFS bandwidth should purchase more data packs to restore access.'

I have provided the full project file inside my google drive.
